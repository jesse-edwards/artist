artist web space 
 I am experimenting with GitHub for the first time. I’m not exactly sure what to do here so I’m just gonna talk into my phone and describe my intentions with the project and here it is. I am looking to create a website that is good for showcasing artwork as well as current products for sale. The products are special edition ceramics usually under 10 items per unique object because of the quality of the molds and how they can only produce so much work before they dissolve. I’m I will also be posting YouTube videos in which I create tutorials for oil painting. I show people how to paint a simple manner that’s easy to understand. Life drawing is often over complicated because of artist that simply do not have experience to have a refined technique.
